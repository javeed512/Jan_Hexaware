Let starts with Linux commands
===============================
Our main goal is to become AWS engineer or DevOps engineer or site reliability engineer.

Here we will learn linux like Cloud or DevOps engineer but not like linux admin.

At any point of time our main goal should not be deviated.

If you want to learn  in and out of linux, it will take 6 to 7 month of time and later we can go for linux Redhat certification.

Whenever we want to learn linux we need to remember following points.

1. In linux everything is a file

2. Linux is a case sensitive i.e a.txt & A.txt.

3. There is no concept of recycle bin (Permanent Delete).

4. There is no concept of file extension in linux i.e .txt, .ppt, .xlsx.

5. In linux we do everything using commands. 

As we know the ecosystem of windows we should remember above points whenever we want
to learn/upgrade linux.

Linux commands link:
---------------------
https://github.com/b54-clouddevops/Linux-Notes


There are 300+ flavors of Linux :

Kali Linux :  
		Majority ethical hacking ppl will use this Flavor

Corporate : 
		RedHat , CentOS ,  Ubuntu , Fedora , IBM AIX , 
		HP_Unix , Cisco Unix ,OEL.

We are going to use CentOS7 for our classes.

linux command syntax
---------------------
	# commandName  {options}  {inputs}


1)uname
---------
uname command gives operating system name which we are using.

It will not give you flavour or  vendor or distribution.

ex:
	input:
		uname 

	output:
		linux 

2)man uname
------------
man command in Linux is used to display the user manual of any command that we can run on the terminal. 
ex:
	input:
		man uname 
		man -a  (It prints all information)
		man -s  (It prints kernel name)
		man -v  (It prints kernel version)
		man -m  (It prints machine type)
		man -r  (It prints kernel release)
		 

In linux there are two types of users.

1) Privileged User (root user) : #

2) Normal User 		       : $ 

Note:
-----
In windows we have adminstrator user as a privileged user. 


3) whoami
-----------
The whoami command allows Linux users to see the currently logged-in user.
ex:
	input:
		whoami

	output:
		centos 

4)sudo su â€“
-----------
Therefore sudo su - will put you into a root environment but it will ask you for your user password instead of the root password (once sudo has given you root privileges, su - can be executed with no password).
ex:
	input:
		sudo su - 
		whoami 

	output:
		root 

5) exit
----------
A exit command in linux is used to exit the shell where it is currently running.
ex:
	input:
		exit 


Q)If I ask you, what is the resources of your computer?

ex:
	Control Panel\System and Security\System 


6) cat /etc/*release
---------------------
A cat command is used to read a file.

A "/etc" is a directory which has all the files related to system.

Here '*' means anything starts with release. 

ex:
	input:
		cat /etc/*release 

Note:
------
	In linux we will use forward slash(/) in commands.
	In windows we will use backward slash(\) in commands.


7) cat /proc/cpuinfo
----------------------
A cat command is used to read a file.

A "proc" is a folder which contains processor related information.

A "cpuinfo" is a file which is present in proc directory and it holds cpu info.

ex:
	input:
		cat /proc/cpuinfo


8) cat /proc/meminfo
----------------------
A cat command is used to read a file.

A "proc" is a folder which contains processor related information.

A "meminfo" is a file which is present in proc directory and it holds memory info.

ex:
	input:
		cat /proc/meminfo


Diagram: aws10.1


9) lsblk
------------
lsblk stands for list the blocks.

It will show how many disks are attached to linux.

ex:
	input:
		lsblk 

10) df
-------
df stands for display the file system.

df command is used to display the amount of disk space available on the file system
in byte format.

ex:
	input:
		df 

Note:
----
	It will display the disk with byte format.

11) df -h
------------
df stands for display the file system.

Here -h stands for human readable format.

df command is used to display the amount of disk space available on the file system
in human readable format.

ex:
	input:
		df -h

Note
-----
	How do we know -h flag is for human understandable.


12) man df
-----------
man command in Linux is used to display the user manual of any command that we can run on the terminal.

df displays the amount of disk space available on the file system.

ex:
	input:
		man df



Q)Can we change disk space in aws?

Yes, it is possible you need to goto EC2 instance and need to do it from there.

We can upgrade the desk space but we can't shrink.


Note:
-------
If your server is is in us-east-1d then you need to create the disk in us-east-1d.

Let see how to create disk by using EBS.
