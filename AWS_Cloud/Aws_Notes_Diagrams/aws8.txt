AWS Launch Template
====================
To create a linux server we need to do lots of configurations and multiple clicks then our sever will be ready. 

To overcome this limitation we need to use lauch template. 

Using launch template we can create a server in just one click.

A launch template is similar to a launch configuration
It contains instance configuration information to launch an instance. 

It includes the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and other parameters used to launch EC2 instances.


Naming standards for creating servers
-------------------------------------
It is highly recommanded to follow naming standards to create a server in aws.

Just by looking at the server we should know following things.

	> What application is running on it.
		ex:	
			payment, user, catalog, cart and etc.

	> What environment it is.
		ex:
			Dev, QA , Pre-Production, Production.

	> Owner or Location of it.	
		ex:
			Diagram: aws8.1	

ex:
	payment-dev-l01	
	cart-qa-l02
	catalog-prod-l03

Note:

Q) we can modify the launh template ? 

Yes, we can modify launch template (click on Actions--> modify the template).

Whenever we modify launch template then new version will be created.
ex:
	if I change t2-micro to t3-micro then new version will generate.



Q) After creating a new version can we goback to old version if needed?

ans) 

	Yes, we can goback to old version if needed 
	(click on Actions-->set default version --> select the template version).
	In this case our default version will be 1 and latest version is 2.
