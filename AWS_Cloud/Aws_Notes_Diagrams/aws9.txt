What is launch configuration
=============================
A launch configuration is a template that an EC2 Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. 

When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping.

Amazon recommanded not to use launch config instead we can use launch template.
