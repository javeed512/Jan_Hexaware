How billing works in EC2 service
=================================
> Based on the type of server (Instance Type).
	ex:
		t1 : 2006 to 2013 (First generation of hardware)
		t2 : 2014 to 2021 (Second generation of hardware)
		t3 : 2021 to till date (Third generation of hardware)

Why amazon buy hardware all the time ? bcz there is a concept called hardware 
refresh.

When they buy hardware from providers like cisco , ibm and etc.They provide support for some extension.

> Based on the OS we are using.

> Based on the size of the Disk(storage).


With respect to billing in EC2, there are varieties on instances.

1) On-demand Instance:

In this case  we are not ensure when we are going create server and terminate server.
On adopt basis , we are creating servers and terminating servers. 

Here billing is very high (> high) 


2) Reserved Instance : 

Whenever we have a vision to stay for a long term then we need to use reserved instance.

Typically when we joined a company, our company product manager or company representative talk to AWS TAM (Techical Account Manager).

ex:
	we will use 1000 cpu and 2TB memory for 3 years

ex:
	Assume you got a job in Banglore.U went and saw some nice 1BHK flat. 

	You don't know when you training will finish and you don't know when
	will you move out from banglore.

	If you goto flat owner and say , sir i would like to stay here for one 
	or two months then owner will say more rent.
	ex:
		1BHK : @2 months : 20,000/-  	
		
	Another guy said sir i would like to stay here for 1 year to 3 years.
	how much owner will take the rent guys?
	ex:	
		1BHK : @ 1 years/3 years  : 13,000/- (Lease)	
	
3) Spot Instance  : Here we will get 95% to 98% discount. spot is gold in company.


Let see how can we check the calculations.

Diagrams

On demand : Monthly: 3.07$/Month   -  Yearly : 36.84$/Year

Reserved instance : Monthly: 1.90$/Month - Yearly : 22.8$/Year 

		    Monthly: 1.31/Month  - Yearly : 15.72$/Year ( 3 years commitment)


AWS Tenancy 
===============
> Shared instances : Here amazon is not having any visibility on flipkart and vice versa.

	
> Dedicated instances : 
	In dedicated instance , banks and insaurance companies don't want other 
	servers should run in the harware where they are running.
	It is costly to the company.

	

> Dedicated Hosts : 

Applications which are developed on-premises need dedicated server like physical server of a data center.

It describes how much cpu and storage required . It specially designed for you.

It is also known as Bare Metal / Physical server.
