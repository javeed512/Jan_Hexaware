About Spot Instances
====================
Each and every cloud provide keeping the futures demand in mind , they designed infrastructure.
ex:
	 If you observed during the covid all the people started working from 
	 home and they starting using zoom , goto meeting and etc.
	
	All these virtual softwares came with SaaS model and end of the day, 
	they also depend upon cloud providers.

	Our cloud providers anticipate what is the future demands and by keeping 
	future demands/Analysis in mind they need to build the infrastruture.

In above diagram,  30% to 50% servers are utilized and rest of the 70% to 50% are under utilization or unutilize.

To overcome this limitation Amazon came with a concept called spot instances. 

It is a savier with respect to the billing bcz it will give you 90% to 98% discount.


Points to remember when we are using SPOT servers
--------------------------------------------------
> Spot servers not for production servers.
> Spot servers are created only for lower environment i.e 
	(dev/test/Integration env): Non-Critical server.
> Spot EC2 servers can't run for more then 24 hours continously.
> AWS can terminate the spot ec2 instance anytime with or without notice.
> We have stop option for spot ec2 instance but earlier it was not there.
> It comes under shared tenancy.
> If spot instance is terminated in less then one hour then not billing.

Let see how billing works when we shutdown the machine

There are lot of companies who provides spot servers in lesser discount.
ex:
	www.spot.io

This "Spot" company associate with major cloud providers.They take spot instances and they do better business.

This type of company coming up by thinking spot as a business.

We can take spot when data is not criticial.

Diagram: aws7.4

In the production we will use 70%-Reserved instances and 30%-Spot instances.

In our training when we are designing our project, we also going to keep costing in mind and we are going to design solution in such a way that , the same project just by changing number of spot or reserved .We should get different sort of servers without changing any thing.

If you join any IT company you can find this type of approach or stratergy to save the cost. 

This information is not confidential , there are many companies published white papers to describes how they save the billings in their companies.

Note:
-----
Request types are two i.e

1)One-time  : You can create the server but you can't stop.

2)Persistence : you can create the server and shutdown or stop the server.

We need to select persistence as a request type.


Interuption behaviour we need to select is "stop".

If server is interrupted by any chance it goes to the shutdown.

To Connect with Xshell we need to type password as "Password123".


How do we come to know the instance is a on-demand, reserved or spot instance.

Diagrams


Creating sport instance means placing a sport request.
> A request will be placed 
> If there are resources available then request will be fullfilled.
> If resources are not available then request will be in pending state.
> When request is fullfilled then that request will create a server.
> If you terminate the spot instance,spot request is going to create one more server.
ex:
	Request           ---------> server 
	Terminate Request ---------> server will be terminated.

Note:
-------
If you are a operations guy there is no point , they give you to create a server.

If you are a monitoring guy then you have only read only access.

Based on the designation in a company they will give you privileges.

How this Access dedication works we will see in upcoming service called AWS Identity and Access Management.
