What is meant by SSO?
Single sign-on (SSO) is an identification method that enables users to log in to multiple applications and websites with one set of credentials.

Principles of OAuth2.0
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and NOT an authentication protocol. As such, it is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of resources, for example, remote APIs or user data. OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens.


For OAuth2.0  we can use 
GitHub Server
Google Server
Facebook server etc

In Github we need to generate client-id and secret:
===================================================
step1 .login to github account
ste2. Go to settings and next page left side goto developers setting
step3. OAuth Apps -->  Register a new OAuth application

  Fill the details and Click Register application button.
step4. Client-id is generated and displayed 
       Now , click generate new client secret

Note: The callback URL is :  http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github    or http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google

Both client id and client secrect should be use/copy in properties file 
Ex: application.properties file.


#GitHub Login using OAuth2

spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-id=  <copy client id here>

spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-secret= <copy client secret here>
