Spring Validations:
==================

Some of the most common validation annotations are:

@NotNull: to say that a field must not be null.
@NotEmpty: to say that a list field must not empty.
@NotBlank: to say that a string field must not be the empty string (i.e. it must have at least one character).
@Min and @Max: to say that a numerical field is only valid when itâ€™s value is above or below a certain value.
@Pattern: to say that a string field is only valid when it matches a certain regular expression.
@Email: to say that a string field must be a valid email address.

Note: We need to add spring / spring boot project

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    </dependency>

Patterns:
========
[A-Z]
[a-z]
[A-Za-z]  Ex;  A , b c  x , S i 
[0-9]    0 , 4 ,5  ,2
[@#$]    @,$,#
[a-z]{4}   ex:  fine , done , king , pink

[A-Z][a-z]     Ex: Am , Hi , Is , Do

[7-9]   8 , 7 , 9 
[A-Z a-z 0-9]   A , a , X , t , 4 , 7 
^[A-Z]...[a-z]$
